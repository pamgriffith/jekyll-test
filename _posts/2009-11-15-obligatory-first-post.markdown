<p>Hooray, I have a blog now!  I've never customized wordpress before, so I'm still trying to work out some kinks (e.g. comment errors should be displayed by the relevant form field, not on a separate page, the blog name at the top right should be a link, etc.) and the rest of the site needs to be integrated somehow.  But I thought I'd put something online now or it would never get online.  So bear with me, not-yet-existing-readership!</p>
<p>I'll be using this space to discuss usability, accessibility, sociability, and perhaps other things that end in "ity".  I've got a few ideas for things to write about, but I've never really blogged before, so we'll see if I ever get around to writing them.  For now, I'll leave you with my favorite error message of all time:</p>
