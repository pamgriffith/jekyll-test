title: Cultural Models in Library Checkout
---

<p>This was a short project from winter quarter 2006 at UCSD. I interviewed a library employee about the checkout process and late-fees. Although in principle if the book is late the person who checked it out gets fined, it turns out that the library employees may choose to be more lenient about applying fees based on a number of factors, principle of which is demand for the book. The paper, including diagrams, can be found <a href="{{site.base_url}}/downloads/library.pdf">here</a>.</p>
