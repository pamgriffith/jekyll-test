<p>In Spring and Fall of 2007 I worked with Josh Teague and Siddharth Gupta to interview people and watch them using their home entertainment systems to see what sorts of things they have, what they do with it, and where things work well or poorly. The research project was funded by Dell, and we provided them <a href="{{site.base_url}}/downloads/Dell3.pdf">this report</a> with suggestions on how they might improve home entertainment systems.</p>
